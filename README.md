# kr40's Kali Aliases

- This is a repo for my Kali aliases. I don't like to change the base Kali installation much, so I use other files for my aliases and the source them to the `.zshrc` file.

- I have included an install script to simply install these to a `.zsh` folder and commands to source them from `.zshrc`.

## Installation

- Clone this repo.
- Give execute permissions to `install.sh` --> `sudo chmod +x install.sh`.
- Run `install.sh` --> `./install.sh`.
- Source `.zshrc` or restart the terminal.
- Install `exa`, `autorecon`, `rustscan` to use their specific aliases.
